# Developer Guidelines

## Introduction

Welcome to pmoscode developer guidelines, known as PDGs. PDG numbers — once assigned — never change, and each PDG deals with special technical topics.

You find the overarching Changelog [here](PDG_0_-_Changelog & Drafts) to see when new PDGs have been added.

## Goal

This PDG's main goal is: Providing reasonable defaults for requirements, components and styles. 
This shall make contribution, maintenance and running products/components as easy as possible.

## Living documentation

Adding new PDG's is the simplest case. Here they are just added and the history is updated.

Once in "active" status, changing or deleting PDG's does not delete the obsolete content. Rather, these are optically "deleted" and, if necessary, supplemented with new content.

## Contribution
