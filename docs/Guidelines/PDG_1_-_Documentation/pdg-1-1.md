## Why

A good written `README.md` file is the entry point for everyone visiting a repository. It should contain all necessary information.

## Description

Each repository **must** contain a `README.md` file which **shall** cover the following topics:

- A short introduction to the software component it offers
- Basic description of the repository and its content
- Installation instructions to get component working
- If required, additional post-installation configuration steps to finish installation
- Optional: Development / contribution instructions 

If installation instructions are too comprehensive for the `README.md`, move content to `INSTALL.md` file and reference it here. See [PDG 1.2](pdg-1-2.md).
