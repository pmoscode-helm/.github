## Why

When a repository contains code which needs to be configured/setup or installed, the `README.md` file should cover this information. 
If this is too much content, it can be moved into a `INSTALL.md` file and referenced in the README.md.

## Description

Create a `INSTALL.md` file in the main folder of the repository and add all installation relevant information.
Also add all post-installation configuration steps to finish installation.
