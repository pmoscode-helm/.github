## Why

Knowing of what changes have been made is very important. Getting information about features, bug and security fixes are mandatory. 

This helps everyone who is using the software to understand what version to choose or when to upgrade.

## Description

To track changes of releases a `CHANGELOG.md` **must** exist in repositories. The format **should** follow the [Keep A Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

The versioning of releases **must** follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

For easy changelog creation, [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) **should** be applied to every commit.
