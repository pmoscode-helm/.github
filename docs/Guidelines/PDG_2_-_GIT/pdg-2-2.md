## Why

To have a unified and common repository structure is helpful when working in more than one project. It can be adapted but should remain consistent.

## Description

All repositories **must** contain the following files and folders:

```text
CONTRIBUTING.md
LICENSE
README.md
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
```

**Optional** files and folders:

```text 
AUTHORS.md
INSTALL.md
SECURITY.md
```
